Global Content Delivery Network for Video Streaming
A media company wants to create a video streaming platform that can serve content to users around the world.
The platform needs to deliver content with low latency and support adaptive streaming for various network conditions. 
How would you design the content delivery system, including storage, transcoding, and global distribution?

### Detailed Design

#### 1. **Architecture Overview**:

   **Global CDN Integration**:
   - Use **Amazon CloudFront** to distribute video content globally with low latency, caching the content closer to the users.
   - Configure CloudFront with **Amazon S3** as the origin for video storage.

   **Adaptive Streaming**:
   - Use **HLS or MPEG-DASH** for adaptive bitrate streaming. The client app will adjust the stream quality based on available bandwidth.

   **Storage**:
   - Store videos in **Amazon S3** for scalable, durable storage.
   - Store metadata about the video (such as format, resolution, etc.) in **Amazon DynamoDB**.

   **Transcoding**:
   - Use **AWS Elemental MediaConvert** to transcode videos into multiple bitrates and formats.
   - Use **Amazon SQS** to queue transcoding jobs and ensure reliable delivery.

   **Streaming Service**:
   - The **StreamingService** fetches the video from **Amazon S3** via **CloudFront**.
   - The client application uses **HLS** or **DASH** protocols to adapt to the user’s network bandwidth.

   **Content Moderation**:
   - For videos requiring content moderation (e.g., based on geography or age), use **Amazon Rekognition** to analyze the content and flag it if necessary.

#### 2. **High-Level Flow**:

   - **Upload Process**:
     1. User uploads a video via UI, which calls the **ContentUploadService**.
     2. The service stores the video temporarily in **S3** and sends a message to **Amazon SQS**.
     3. The **TranscoderService** listens to the SQS queue and processes the video using **AWS MediaConvert**, creating multiple renditions for different bandwidths.
     4. The transcoded files are then stored back in **S3**.

   - **Viewing Process**:
     1. When a user requests a video, the **ViewingService** first checks **Amazon CloudFront** for cached content.
     2. If not cached, it retrieves the video from **S3** via **CloudFront**.
     3. Based on the client’s network conditions, **HLS/DASH** streaming adapts the quality.

#### 3. **Microservices**:
   - **ContentUploadService**: Handles video uploads, stores in S3, and enqueues transcoding tasks.
   - **TranscoderService**: Listens to SQS for jobs, transcodes videos using **AWS MediaConvert**, and stores them back to S3.
   - **ContentCheckService**: Optionally performs moderation checks using **Amazon Rekognition**.
   - **StreamingService**: Streams videos using **HLS** or **DASH** through CloudFront.
   - **ViewingService**: Handles video viewing requests, fetching from CloudFront or S3 if needed.
   - **NotificationService**: Sends notifications (via SNS) when transcoding is complete.

#### 4. **Data Management**:
   - **Video Metadata**: Store in **Amazon DynamoDB**, including video ID, resolution, bitrates, and format.
   - **Content Storage**: Store actual videos in **Amazon S3**, and configure **S3 Lifecycle policies** to move older content to **S3 Glacier**.

#### 5. **Scalability**:
   - Use **Amazon CloudFront** to deliver cached content globally with low latency.
   - Deploy **multiple instances of microservices** (ContentUploadService, TranscoderService, etc.) using **AWS Lambda** or **ECS** with auto-scaling.
   - Use **DynamoDB Global Tables** for replication and sharding for storing content metadata.
   - Autoscale **MediaConvert** transcoding based on queued jobs to handle varying loads.

#### 6. **High Availability**:
   - Store video content in **S3**, which offers high availability and durability across multiple regions.
   - Use **Multi-AZ deployment** for DynamoDB and S3 replication for resilience.
   - CloudFront edge servers ensure the video is served from the closest location for minimal latency.

#### 7. **Security**:
   - Use **Amazon Cognito** for authentication and access management.
   - Encrypt data at rest using **S3 encryption** and **KMS**.
   - Use **HTTPS/SSL** for all data transmission.
   - Implement **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control) for user privileges.

#### 8. **Disaster Recovery**:
   - Depending on the RTO/RPO requirements:
     - **Multi-site deployment** for near-zero downtime.
     - **Active-passive failover** for short downtime.
     - Implement **backup and recovery plans** using **S3 versioning** and **Glacier**.

#### 9. **Data Retention**:
   - Use **DynamoDB TTL** for content metadata.
   - Implement S3 lifecycle policies for automatic archival to **S3 Glacier** after a certain period.

#### 10. **Monitoring**:
   - Use **CloudWatch** to monitor service metrics (latency, error rates, etc.).
   - Set up alarms for thresholds (e.g., high latency, transcoding failures).
   - Use **AWS CloudTrail** to track API usage and ensure compliance.
