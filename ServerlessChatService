1. Functional Requirements:
Real-time messaging, media sharing, and notifications are well-defined.
Questions to be asked (like supported message types, notifications, daily active users, etc.) are crucial for detailed design.
Additional questions should be related to performance (i.e., expected concurrent users) and data retention policies.

2. Non-functional Requirements:
The application needs scalability, fault tolerance, low latency, high availability, and security. 
These are all adequately addressed in your design. However, specifying concrete latency expectations, handling high-throughput scenarios, and data recovery plans need more detail.
Gaps and Recommendations:
1. Real-time Messaging:
AWS API Gateway with WebSockets is a good choice for handling real-time messaging. Make sure to clarify how you'll handle real-time events through WebSocket connections efficiently at scale.
Elasticity of WebSocket Connections: You’ll need to plan for scaling WebSocket connections dynamically, as managing millions of concurrent connections may require sophisticated load balancing.
Stateful/Stateless Handling: Clarify whether the services involved (e.g., MessageService, ChatServer) are stateless. This will impact how they are deployed and scaled.

2. Media Sharing:
Object storage like Amazon S3 is mentioned for storing media, which is appropriate.
Optimization: Use S3 Multipart Upload to optimize uploads for larger media files.
URL Expiry: Make sure to use S3 pre-signed URLs with an expiration time for sharing media files.
Media Duplication Check: Your idea of hashing the media content before saving is excellent, but clarify whether 
you're performing this at the client side or the server side to avoid large files being uploaded unnecessarily.

3. Notifications:
AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service) is well-suited for push notifications, and AWS Pinpoint can be used for more sophisticated notification workflows (push, SMS, email).
For global users, ensure you're using region-specific endpoints to optimize the delivery of notifications to different geographies.

4. Security:
End-to-End Encryption (E2EE): This is a critical requirement. While you mentioned KMS for data encryption, E2EE for messaging should use a client-side key exchange mechanism 
(e.g., Diffie-Hellman key exchange) to ensure that message content remains secure, even from server-side decryption.
Authentication and Authorization: While you mention Cognito for user authentication, ensure role-based access control (RBAC) is enforced via JWT tokens for specific user roles and actions.

5. Presence and Offline Messaging:
User Presence: You mention an OnlinePresenceService to check the user's online status. Ensure that this service is updated in real-time by subscribing to WebSocket connections/disconnections and storing state in a fast-access, in-memory data store like Amazon ElastiCache (Redis).
Offline Messaging: If a user is offline, you store messages in DynamoDB. This is fine, but ensure proper indexing of messages to allow efficient retrieval when the user comes back online.

6. Message Delivery Guarantees:
Event-Driven Architecture: Using AWS EventBridge is a good approach for event-driven messaging and updates, but it's crucial to ensure at-least-once delivery of messages.
Consider incorporating SQS (Simple Queue Service) between MessageService and ChatServer to buffer messages in case of any temporary server downtime.

7. Scalability:
Load Balancer: You mentioned using a load balancer for distributing load across services, but ensure you're using AWS-specific services like API Gateway and AWS Lambda to take full advantage of serverless scalability.
Global Scale: For global users, implement AWS Global Accelerator for better latency and reliability when routing requests to the nearest available region.

8. Fault Tolerance:
AWS services like DynamoDB Global Tables and S3 Cross-Region Replication can improve fault tolerance. 
Ensure that every component can seamlessly switch over to other regions in case of failure.

9. Low Latency:
Edge Computing: To further reduce latency, you can leverage AWS CloudFront for distributing static content and even exploring Lambda@Edge for executing code closer to the users.

10. Data Retention:
You mentioned DynamoDB TTL for managing message expiration. Ensure that you also consider compliance and data privacy rules (such as GDPR) for data retention and deletion.
S3 Object Lifecycle Policies can be used to move expired messages to long-term, cost-effective storage like S3 Glacier.

11. Disaster Recovery:
Clarify the RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) requirements. For a chat application, minimizing data loss is critical, 
so multi-region, active-active deployment may be more suitable than active-passive.

12. Monitoring and Logging:
AWS CloudWatch should be set up with detailed metrics to monitor WebSocket connections, API calls, latency, and DynamoDB read/write capacity. Ensure you configure proper CloudWatch Alarms for critical thresholds like message delivery delays or increased error rates.
Additionally, use AWS X-Ray for tracing requests across the system to identify latency bottlenecks.

Detailed Design Proposal:
Architecture Overview:
Frontend: Mobile/Web client (React Native/Flutter for mobile, React/Angular for web)

Use WebSocket for real-time messaging.
Media sharing via pre-signed URLs.
Push notifications via SNS/Pinpoint.
Backend (Serverless Microservices):

API Gateway: Handles HTTP requests and WebSocket connections.
Lambda Functions: Handles business logic for message processing, notifications, and media handling.
DynamoDB: NoSQL database for message storage, user presence, and metadata.
DynamoDB Global Tables for cross-region replication.
S3: For storing media (images, videos) and message backups.
SQS: Message queuing between services to ensure reliable message delivery.
EventBridge: For handling message status updates (sent, delivered, read) and notifications.
ElastiCache (Redis): For user presence and real-time state tracking.
Cognito: For user authentication and authorization.
KMS: For encryption of messages at rest.


Flow of Chat Application Using AWS Services
Client Interaction: The user sends a message from the mobile/web client, which is forwarded to the API Gateway.
AWS Lambda (Message Processing): The message is passed to an AWS Lambda function that processes the message content, checks the recipient’s online status via Redis (Amazon ElastiCache).
Amazon SQS (Message Queueing): If the recipient is offline, the message is pushed into SQS, which queues the message for reliable delivery.
Amazon S3 (Media Storage): If the message contains media, such as images or videos, Lambda saves the content in Amazon S3 and generates a URL, which is sent via SQS.
Amazon DynamoDB (Message Storage): Both media links and text messages are saved in DynamoDB, ensuring persistence and durability of messages.
AWS EventBridge (Message Status): To track message status (sent, delivered, read), EventBridge captures status events, which Lambda processes and updates in DynamoDB.
Amazon SNS (Notifications): SNS sends notifications to the user when new messages are received or when there’s a status update, such as "message delivered" or "message read."
Message Delivery to Recipient: When the recipient comes online, the chat application retrieves the message from SQS and delivers it in real-time through WebSocket connections via API Gateway.
